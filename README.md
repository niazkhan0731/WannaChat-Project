# Introducing WannaChat! 💬
Experience the Power of Realtime Communication! 🗣

We are super excited to be working on this cutting-edge Chat Application, a joint effort with my associate <a href="https://www.github.com/sajib1066">Sajib</a>. 💻🤝

Harnessing the power of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap framework, Python, Django, and PostgreSQL, we've crafted a dynamic web application that enables users to join real-time chatrooms on diverse topics from all over the world. 

Currently, we're enhancing the platform with exciting features like user profiles, friend lists, and direct messaging. 🚀🌐

Join us on this thrilling journey as we redefine the way people connect and communicate in real-time. Stay tuned for updates and the final release! 🌟

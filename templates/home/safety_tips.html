    <p>Here are a few safety tips that will help to prevent someone from compromising your profile. Please take a moment to review them. Thanks!.</p>
    <h5>Passwords</h5>
    <p>
        For registered users choosing a strong password is very important. There are programs that can guess your password by trial and error (i.e. a1234) or some other commonly spoken word. Random numbers & letters are the best way to keep
        your passwords secure.
    </p>
    <h5>Private Messaging.</h5>
    <p>
        Be cautious of people sending you private messages you asking you to click a link, may ask you for money, or trying to get your personal information. If your profile has been compromised or you know of someone who is spreading bad
        links, please contact us ASAP.

    <h5>Meeting and Dating people</h5>
    <p>
        Do not meet anyone in person who you have met online from Chatib. You might think you've met someone who is completely trustworthy, but you can't be positive they are who they say they are. Always alert your parents before making
        decisions about meeting people from the internet and be sure they come with you and that it is in a public setting. Don't let yourself be lured by senseless promises such as a model agent wanting to make you a model or promises of
        money, gifts, and the like as a reward for photos or a meeting.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Use a nickname online that doesn't include your real name and isn't aimed to attract sexual attention</p>
    <h5>Parents and Guardians</h5>
